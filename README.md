# SCP:SL - Cheat
### How to edit/work with this source.

 - You have to run "Keygen.exe", it will create a registration file on
   Your PC so you can edit/use the Guna Framework that we use.
- Located:
    -  SCPSL-stealth/Frameworks/Guna.UI.Activation.Framework/GunaUIKeygen/
   Keygen.exe

### How to update/get Offsets.
I've added an easy/automated way to Dump Offsets for this game, all you have todo is to run the "DumpOffsets.bat"
Requirements:
 - SCP:SL must be installed in the default Steam Library 
   - C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\SCP Secret Laboratory
- Located:
  - SCPSL-stealth/Offset Dumping/DumpOffsets.bat

It will then generate a file called "dump.cs" in the Folder "OffsetDumpOutput", it will include all important offsets you need to either update or add new stuff to the cheat.

There is another project embedded in the main one, this is just for testing and should be ignored.
It's written in c++ and only for testing right now.

The rest should be pretty  self explanatory.

Have fun!
