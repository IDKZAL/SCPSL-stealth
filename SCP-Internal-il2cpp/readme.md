I have found time to learn megapatch2 changes in SCPSL game.

Old repo is read-only from now.

# Preview

This project is a base for il2cpp game hack. You can make a couple changes to make it work with any other game, not SCPSL only.

# Updates

v0.4: hooking game thread to bypass GC detection.

v0.5: fetching component data example.

v0.6: engine rendering, removed old GUI

v0.7: scopophobia update, AC bypass

v0.8: auto screen resolution change support

v0.9: better transform handling & more interesting il2cpp class
